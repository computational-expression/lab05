# Lab 5 Reflection

## IoT Device Management

Describe how you created your smart home monitoring system. Use markdown lists to structure your responses:

- **Device lists:** What two main lists did you create to manage IoT devices?
- **List modification:** How did you use `append()` and `remove()` methods for device control?
- **Device categorization:** How did you organize devices by type (e.g., security, HVAC, lighting)?

## Hardware Integration

Describe how you integrated hardware components with your IoT system:

- **LED indicators:** How did the 3 LEDs represent different home systems?
- **Button control:** How did button confirmation enhance the user experience?
- **Status monitoring:** How did LEDs provide real-time feedback of device states?

## List Operations

Describe the specific list operations you used in your smart home system:

- **append() method:** How did you use this to "turn on" devices?
- **remove() method:** How did you use this to "turn off" devices?
- **List membership:** How did you check if devices were already active using `in` operator?
- **List iteration:** How did you use for loops to display device lists?

## IoT Concepts

Describe how your program demonstrated real IoT concepts:

- **Device status tracking:** How did your lists simulate real IoT device management?
- **System categorization:** How did you group devices by home system types?
- **Interactive control:** How did button confirmation simulate secure device commands?

## Creative Choices

Describe any creative choices you made in your smart home system:

- **Device names:** What IoT devices did you choose and why?
- **User interface:** How did you make the control system user-friendly?
- **Status display:** How did you organize the device status information?

## Challenges

Describe the main challenges you faced with list modification and IoT simulation:

- **List method usage:** What difficulties did you encounter with append() and remove()?
- **Device logic:** How did you handle the LED status indicator logic?
- **Hardware integration:** What challenges arose with button input and LED control?

## Learning

What are the most important things you learned about:

- **List modification methods** and their practical applications
- **IoT device management** concepts and real-world connections  
- **Interactive programming** with hardware confirmation

## Improvements

If you were to complete this assignment again, what would you do differently to:

- Improve your device management logic
- Create more realistic IoT simulations
- Enhance the user interface experience
